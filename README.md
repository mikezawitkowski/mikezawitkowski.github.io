## What is this about?

In the summer of 2021, I decided that the word that would be in the box for me would be "community," but I needed to give myself plenty of time and space and room to reflect and figure out what that word even *means* to me. Is it "community," or is it "belonging", or maybe "connection"? Or, something completely different? That process of meditating on that word took almost exactly three years.

In the summer 2024, I decided that I would dedicate the rest of my life to "community." To building community, and contributing to the health and nourishment of existing communities. 
 
To creating a greater sense of belonging in the world. To fostering safe places for individuals and groups to try hard things. 

To allowing fellow human being to feel more seen, more heard, and more supported.

I also set a personal goal for myself. **My goal is to make a positive impact for at least 10,000 communities that have cumulatively at least 10 million community members, and to achieve this impact in no more than 10 years.** 

And that goal is what this website is about.

Hi, I’m Mike Zawitkowski.

I’ll introduce myself fully in just a moment. 

## The Trends

But first I want to share with you a taste of the journey I've been that has led me to creating this site. After investing literally hundreds of hours into listening and learning, pouring over data and intently absorbing stories of those that have come before me, I've observed two collections of trends that are creating a perfect storm in our society today.

The first group of trends is the overwhelming amount of evidence about the importance of community, belonging, and safe spaces where you can be yourself. And the amount of evidence continues to grow as we learn more about ourselves in a world after COVID. And even more evidence shows that our success is more attributed to who we know than what we know.

But a second set of trends are about how we are unintentionally making it extremely difficult to connect with others. Both COVID and our relationship with technology have created a synergy that has led to more isolation than ever before. And that sense of isolation and loneliness is growing.

Therefore, we need ways to take advantage of the first set of trends while combatting the second set of trends.

And our need for community and belonging are stronger than ever. In fact, to take a related example from our personal lives, the Surgeon General has issued an advisory that the challenges of parenting today is leading to record levels of problems with mental health and well being for 63 americans. And one of the strongest recommendations for parents dealing with this stress is to connect with peers going through similar issues.

## The Journey

For over a decade I’ve been a student of culture, community, and the psychology of groups and organizations. And in fact, I've worked hard out of a selfish personal interest to create community and found family.

But journeys like this are really hard to do by yourself. For years I’ve wanted to set up a community or two to support my personal and professional interests, and I realized how difficult it is to do this as a passive activity. In fact, in my very own neighborhood I've watched as community became more important than ever during COVID, and then in the post-COVID hangover it lost critical mass and fizzled out as key people who were pillars of our culture moved away.

And the value that you get by having the opportunity to meet regularly with your peers to share experiences, provide support to one another, and to feel seen and heard is both measurably valuable and also has tremendous intangible and priceless benefits to you and all of those around you. 

Recently I made what I thought was an appropriately ambitious statement to motivate me and inspire others around me, one that I call my "power of 10" mission: **to make a positive impact for at least 10,000 communities that have cumulatively at least 10 million community members, and to achieve this impact in no more than 10 years.** The follow up question is typically, "How do you plan to do that, exactly?" Or, "How will you measure success?" And my response with what I imagine is a huge grin is, I'm not exactly sure—and I'm looking forward to finding out. 

It's like one of my favorite writers John Scalzi has said when he sits down to write a book. When [interviewed about his writing process](https://chireviewofbooks.com/2017/03/22/how-john-scalzi-wrote-the-collapsing-empire/) Scalzi responded: "I have friends who exhaustively outline every single thing, and I would *hate* that. It would suck all the fun out of it, because I like writing to find out what’s going to happen next."


## Some possible directions for what is next

There are a few directions I'm aggressively exploring that relate to community that intersect with my professional background.

### Peer groups

The first and most obvious area I'm exploring is the value of peer groups. I'm fascinated by what happens when you get a group of people with one strong component that they have in common, add the right conditions or ingredients, and immediately create a connection that is valuable to the group and to the individuals. In the Entrepreneur Organization, where they have peer-moderated forums of entrepreneurs meeting in a confidential setting, they call this phenomenon "insta-macy" playing on a combination of the words "instant" and "intimacy." 

In fact, I've collected models where these individuals pay as much as thousands of dollars a month to meet regularly with like minded individuals. I believe I could eventually create this same level of "insta-macy" for a much lower amount of money.

Additionally, I've collected multiple examples where one or more organizations realized a very high return on their investment by investing in or sponsoring others to form these groups. In one scenario, peer groups comprised of a sponsor's future dream customers were assembled, and a high value experience curated for the members, all paid for by the sponsor. Not only was this highly valuable for the attendees, but the sponsoring organization had the opportunity to be top of mind for these individuals and realized multiple millions of net new revenue directly attributed to the existence of these peer groups. 

I've also collected use cases where there were sponsors involved AND the members paid in order to be a part of the community. 

Those are just some of the many examples of peer groups, or masterminds, or whatever you'd like to call them, provide value to attendees and those in the ecosystem surrounding these communities.

**UPDATE: I'm currently seeking one agency, managed service provider, consulting firm, or professional services provider that will allow me to create a peer group with them as a "sponsor" for FREE in exchange for allowing me to write up a case study on the results should it prove to be a positive outcome for those involved. If you are interested in being part of the pilot program please contact me ASAP at mike@mikezawitkowski.com.**

### Supporting Community Organizations

My journey has thankfully allowed me to cross paths with some amazing individuals and groups that are doing the hard work day in and day out of improving communities that in a number of ways are marginalized, underfunded, or simply lack the support they deserve for no good reason. I've heard incredible stories that were shared with me in the oral tradition, and have some compelling data illustrating the impact of their work, but for one reason or another there is no written record of these accomplishments. I'm eager to explore how to help these organizations through the decades of experience I've gained in working with data, and by leveraging the network of technologists, staticians, and data experts in my own community and network.

### Supporting small towns, counties and communities

I've recently learned of a small town of 8,000 people who have decided to spend $50,000 of their precious funds on a data analysis project. I've seen the results of that work. They are what we call descriptive statistics, and while interesting they are not particularly actionable.

For much less than $50,000 I would have gladly shared my past work using externally available data such as weather, traffic patterns, unemployment, gas prices, and similar sources of information that are highly correlated with changes in human behavior, and overlayed that with 911 calls for service. You see, you can use weather and ambient temperature to predict what type of emergency will happen and in which neighborhood or zipcode *hours* before the call comes in. It is fascinating to see these patterns appear in the data. With this information you can make smarter decisions about staffing and supply chain, for starters.

Therefore, I see there are great opportunities to help smaller communities with understanding such trends, and the impact on the communities is not only saving time and money, but literally include lifesaving insights.

### ...and what else?

As I mentioned, I'm still at the beginning of this journey. I am wide open to the possibilities. If you have stories to share about what community and belonging mean to you, I hope you will reach out and share them with me.
